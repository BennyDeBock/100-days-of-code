# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Personal goals of this challenge

I have a few personal projects I seem to be making little progress on as well as technologies I would like to learn. In this 100 days of code, I want to learn how to use Vue.js and rebuild the website of my table tennis club in it. If there is spare time, I'd like to also include my portfolio.

### Day 0: July 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Went through 7/66 videos of a Vue.js tutorial.

**Thoughts:** So far so good, Vue is a bit different from Angular which I learned throughout my student career, but for now the differences seem minimal. The `v-` tags will take some time getting used to though.

**To Do:** Continue the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CdLj6ExjX0&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwgeQIfSDtEGVvvSEPDkL_1f&index=8)
