# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Personal goals of this challenge

I have a few personal projects I seem to be making little progress on as well as technologies I would like to learn. In this 100 days of code, I want to learn how to use Vue.js and rebuild the website of my table tennis club in it. If there is spare time, I'd like to also include my portfolio.

### Day 0: July 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Went up to 7/66 videos of a Vue.js tutorial.

**Thoughts:** So far so good, Vue is a bit different from Angular which I learned throughout my student career, but for now the differences seem minimal. The `v-` tags will take some time getting used to though.

### Day 1: July 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Went up to 14/66 videos of a Vue.js tutorial. Learned about conditional rendering as well as list rendering.

**Thoughts:** Vue seems to be a bit easier to grasp than Angular, but that might be because i'm familiar with component based systems. However, i do find the v-tags to be quite easy to use. The template tag is quite nice as well.

### Day 2: July 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Went up to 27/66 videos of a Vue.js tutorial. Learned about event handling, form handling, modifiers and computed properties in Vue.

**Thoughts:** Froms and event handling is mostly the same as I've experienced in Angular, though made a bit easier. I also learned what the difference is between computed properties and methods in vue. Furthermore, i found out by mistake I can view my app on my phone when running a vue application in development. That'll make mobile development that much easier.

### Day 3: July 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Went up to 34/66 videos of a Vue.js tutorial. Learned about Vue components, component props and provide/inject.

**Thoughts:** The way of handling components is pretty easy. The non-props is new to me however. I don't remember having anything like that in Angular when I was using it. I'm now officially halfway through the tutorial series, so i can start rebuilding the table tennis website soon!

### Day 4: July 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Redid the CSS for showing pictures in an album. Added a nice effect to accentuate the hovered over picture. Sorted the albums in descending order so the newer ones show first.

**Thoughts:** It's been a hot minute since i did CSS so this was a good refresher, though this came with hardships.
