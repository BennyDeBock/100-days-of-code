# 100-days-of-code
A challenge to code every day for at least an hour (though breaks are permitted). Through doing this, you force yourself to create a habit of coding, to get better at something, to finally finish that project that you wanted to finish at some point. All this and more could be reasons to undertake this challenge. It most certainly is the reason I'm undertaking this challenge.
